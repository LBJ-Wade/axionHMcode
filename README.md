# The non-linear power spectrum with axionHMcode

axionHMcode is a code to compute the non-linear matter power spectrum in a mixed dark matter cosmology with ultar-light axion (ULA) component of the dark matter. A very accurate halo model for a LCDM or massive neutrino cosmology is given by [Mead et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858) by the 'HMcode'. Since this model uses some of the fitting parameters and is ininspired by this ode the presented code in named after 'HMcode'.

## Theory

The model computes the non-linear power specrum by using the full expanded power spectrum

The cold part can be computed as usally with the standard halo model (see [Massara et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6813) or [Mead et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858)) whereas the cross and axion part have to take into accound the non clustering of axions on small scales due to free-streaming. THis is done be spliting the axion overdensity into a clustered and linear component. For details see Massara et al. (TBC) where the same full treatment were be used for massive neutrinos, but can be translated for any other warm/hot, \ie free streaming, matter component. 

## How Does the Code Work?

The code expexted an input file as given in "input_file.txt" and an executable 'axionCAMB' programm named ./camb . The code works for an axion mass range of [10^-28 eV, 10^21 eV] and at the moment for a fraction of 10% axions of the total dark matter. 
A example python file is given in "example_file.py". To run the file you have to change the input_file_path and the axionCAMB_exe_path. If the paths are not correct the python code will produce an error massage. Beside the non-linear total matter power spectrum the example path also computes the non-linear power spectrum in a LCDM cosnology whete the axion part is transformed into CDM. Both power spectra are saved in a file named as given by the varaible "datafile_path". The units of the wavenumber and the power psectra are h/Mpc and (Mpc/h)^3 respectively. The code also plot the ratio between the MDM and LCDM linear and non-linear power spectrum.
The total computstion time is around 4 minutes. The time is much longer than e.g. the HMcode since the code has to compute some axion halo parameters for which no fitting functions are given and had to compute for each halo indivu√≠daly (see masterthesis or aks me, if you have a question about it). 

## Code Modifications

The axionHMcode can also uses some paramaters from the 'HMcode' from Mead et al. which improve the predictions. The patameters can switch on by the setting the coresponding parametrs to True or Fals in the function for the non-linear power spectrum. The parameters are the smoothing parameter, alpha, the halo bloating term, eta_given, the one halo dmoing on lage scales, one_halo_damping and the two halo damping on large scales, two_halo_damping. By default only the one halo damping is switched on, because on large scales the non-linear power spectrum should be eqal to the linear which is given by the two halo term and thus the one halo term has to be damped on large scales (see [Mead et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858) for details).
